# Data and Scripts for "Local climate and vernalization sensitivity predict the latitudinal patterns of flowering onset in the crop wild relative Linum bienne Mill."
This is the project folder to clean and andalyze the data about the flowering phenology of Linum bienne and Linum usitatissimum as published in the paper you can access here [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcae040).
Genetic data on the population structure of Linum bienne in the west of its native distribution are also available in the repository, with the script to analyze them. Climatic data can be downloaded from Worldclim and have not been uploaded to GitHub.

Before running, create a output folder. Then run scripts from 1 to 5. The scripts will craete files that are used in successive analyses. If you do not run them all, you will have problems.
