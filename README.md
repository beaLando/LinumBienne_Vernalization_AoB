# Data and Scripts for "Local climate and vernalization sensitivity predict the latitudinal patterns of flowering onset in the crop wild relative Linum bienne Mill."
This is the project directory to clean and andalyze the datasets regarding the flowering phenology and genetic structure of L. bienne populations and L. usitatissimum cultivars described in the work published [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcae040).
Climatic data have not been uploaded to GitHub because they can be downloaded from Worldclim: https://www.worldclim.org/data/worldclim21.html. The scripts also include a step to download the climatic data via R directly.

Before running, create a subdirectory ./output in the project's main directory. Also create a subdirectory ./data/climate in ./data. 
Then run the scripts from 1 to 5. These scripts generate intermediate outputs that are used in consecutive steps, so you need to run them in order.
